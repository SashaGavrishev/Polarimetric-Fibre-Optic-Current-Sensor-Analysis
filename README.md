# Polarimetric Fibre Optic Current Sensor Analysis

Analysis code for a polarimetric fibre optic current sensor (FOCS) developed while conducting a UROP at the Imperial Plasma Physics research group.

The file full_analysis.py is an example of how one can combine the packages developed for this type of FOCS to process the data. It is designed as a file that will run with no further modification, though at its core it is only designed to process data from one specific oscilloscope format - though this is likely not a difficult modification to make.
